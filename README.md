# 📊 Time Series Projects

I don’t just predict the future, I model it. These projects use a mix of **deep learning, classic stats, and real-world data** to forecast sales, prevent breakdowns, and plan smarter. Basically, if it moves through time, I’ve probably modeled it.

### 🛍️ [Retail Sales Forecasting ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/retail-sales-forceasting)

Used **Prophet, SARIMA, and XGBoost** to predict retail sales like a boss. Trends? Caught. Seasonality? Detected. Forecasts? Clean. Great for businesses that like being three steps ahead.

### 🏭 [Predictive Maintenance for Manufacturing Data ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/predictive-maintenance-manufacturing)

Sensor data + survival modeling = **early warnings for equipment failure**. This one’s for the factories that want fewer breakdowns and more uptime, I’m talkin’ predictive power on the production line.

### 📦 [Multi-Product Demand Forecasting with LSTM ➜](https://github.com/lexusimni/multi-product-demand-forecasting)

Forecast demand across multiple SKUs using **LSTM networks** trained on multivariate time series. Think of it as supply chain clairvoyance, powered by neural nets and hustle.
